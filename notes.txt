** To Install Ruby and execute .rb programs:
sudo apt install ruby

** methods in Ruby
        Methods are in ruby executed normally like in other languages, in these methods 
the last executed statement get returned from the method.


** Idiomatic style 
        It is used for naming convention of variables, methods 
as by putting uderscore in two words and words staring with lower case letters.

** Constant
        The variable name or class names starts with capital letters are meant to be 
constants (Constant's name and Class name should be Constant i.e. it should starts 
with capital letters) 

** Question mark ?
        It is used to check wheather variables is true or false 

** Exclaimation mark !
        It is used to state wheather the method is dangerous or not

** Strip method
        String class method used for removing leading and trailing white spaces from a string.

** IRB (Intractive Ruby)
        IRB stands for “interactive ruby” and is a tool to interactively execute ruby 
expressions read from the standard input.

** Modules 
        Modules are similar like class but their are some differences in class and module as 
modules does not provide object oriented facility as it neither get inherited nor instanciated.
Modules are simply liabrary of methods, constants, variables. We can use modules in 2 ways
either by including it or by extending it.

** Inclusion of Module
        Syntax:  include Module_name
        by including module the methods gets bind to the object instance

** Extending a Module
        Syntax:  extend Module_name
        by extending module the methods gets bind to the class itself

** backtick or %x
        Used to execute command on shell

** system 
        Same as backtick but one more advantage of system is it also returns 
execution status i.e. true or false

** Acceesers
        In class data is by default private and methods are public

** define method        
        It is used to define method dynamically

** yield statement
        It is used to get into block, we can also pass parameters to the yield statement

** idiom 



** Lambda
        It is similar like proc, Lambda is unnamed function, If you pass the wrong number of arguments to a lambda, it will raise 
an exception, just like a regular method.

** IMP Difference between procs and lambda
        1) Lambdas are defined with -> {} and procs with Proc.new {}.
2) Procs return from the current method, while lambdas return from the lambda itself.
3) Procs don’t care about the correct number of arguments, while lambdas will raise an exception.

** rescue in Exception Handling
        Everything from begin to rescue is protected. If an exception occurs during the 
execution of this block of code, control is passed to the block between rescue and end.
